### Summary
Implement a new function that sends logs to the device and supports saving and logging these entries to a log file for persistence and troubleshooting.

### Details
- Create a function that can send log messages directly to the device for real-time monitoring.
- Extend the same functionality to save the logs locally in a log file.
- Ensure that logs include timestamps and relevant context.
- Consider log rotation or file size management to prevent uncontrolled log file growth.

### How to implement
Leave empty if you have no idea what should be here

### Benefits
- Easier troubleshooting by tracking events and errors on the device.
- Persistent record of activity for future review.
